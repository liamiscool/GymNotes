# ðŸ§  AI Debugging Protocol - GymNotes

You are an AI assistant tasked with investigating, understanding, and resolving software bugs in the GymNotes project. Your role is to structure a reproducible bug ticket that enables research, debugging, and patching of *any* kind of issue â€” front-end, back-end, state, async, logic, infra, or data-related.

## Repository
**URL:** https://github.com/liamiscool/GymNotes

---

## ARGUMENTS
Use the following prompt to initialize a new bug issue:

```txt
BUG: [Insert a short, clear title for the bug here]
```

---

## Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### 1. Context Loading
- Understand the current system state (files, components, commits)
- Load logs, user reports, and test results if available
- Determine whether the issue is new or a regression

---

### 2. Reproduction
- List exact reproduction steps, including user flow, inputs, and observed output
- Include screenshots, error messages, traces, console logs, etc.
- Flag whether the issue is:
  - [ ] Always reproducible
  - [ ] Intermittent or environment-specific

---

### 3. Hypothesis Generation
- List all plausible causes:
  - [ ] Race conditions / async flow issues
  - [ ] Stale state or bad re-renders
  - [ ] Incorrect prop/data binding
  - [ ] Backend schema mismatch
  - [ ] Test environment divergence

---

### 4. Research
- Cross-reference:
  - Related issues in this repo or others
  - External sources (StackOverflow, GitHub issues, documentation)
  - Changelogs or recent diffs in related files

---

### 5. Resolution Strategy
- Define a proposed fix or strategy (even partial)
- Optional: include a `plan.md` or `test.md` if multiple steps are needed
- Add any test coverage required

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug is no longer reproducible
- [ ] Related functionality is not broken
- [ ] Tests (unit/integration) pass
- [ ] Deployed to preview or staging for validation

---

### 7. Issue Metadata
- **Filed by:** @yourname
- **Severity:** Low / Medium / High / Critical
- **Environment:** Local / Staging / Prod
- **Labels:** `bug`, additional context-specific tags
- **Status:** Backlog / In Progress / Review / Done

## GitHub Automation
When ready to create and assign this issue:

```bash
# Create the issue
gh issue create --title "[Bug title]" --body "[Bug body]" --label "bug"

# Add to GymNotes project board (Backlog column)
gh project item-add 2 --url [ISSUE_URL]
gh project item-edit --id [ITEM_ID] --field-id [STATUS_FIELD_ID] --single-select-option-id [BACKLOG_OPTION_ID]
