You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured GitHub issues for feature
  requests, bug reports, or improvement ideas. Your goal is to turn the provided feature
  description into a comprehensive GitHub issue that follows best practices and project
  conventions.

  First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. Here they are:
  <feature_description>
  #$ARGUMENTS
  </feature_description>

  Repository URL: https://github.com/liamiscool/GymNotes

  Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

  ## 1. Research the repository:
  - Visit the provided repo_url and examine the repository's structure, existing issues, and 
  documentation
  - Look for any CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, or similar files that might contain
  guidelines for creating issues
  - Note the project's coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for
  submitting issues
  - Understand the current architecture and components

  ## 2. Research best practices:
  - Search for current best practices in writing GitHub issues, focusing on clarity,
  completeness, and actionability
  - Look for examples of well-written issues in popular open-source projects for inspiration
  - Consider the perspective of both maintainers and contributors

  ## 3. Present a plan:
  - Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the GitHub issue
  - Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and
  how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions
  - Present this plan in <plan> tags

  ## 4. Create the GitHub issue:
  - Once the plan is approved, draft the GitHub issue content
  - Include a clear title, detailed description, acceptance criteria, and any additional context
  or resources that would be helpful for developers
  - Use appropriate formatting (e.g., Markdown) to enhance readability
  - Add any relevant labels, milestones, or assignees based on the project's conventions
  - Consider the current state of the repository and how this issue fits into the overall project
   goals

  ## 5. Final output and project board integration:
  - Present the complete GitHub issue content in <github_issue> tags
  - Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags in your final output
  - Make sure the content is ready to be copied and pasted directly into GitHub
  - Use the GitHub CLI 'gh issue create' to create the actual issue after you generate
  - Assign either the label 'bug' or 'enhancement' based on the nature of the issue
  - **IMPORTANT**: After creating the issue, automatically add it to the "GymNotes Development"
  project board and assign it to the "Backlog" status/column using these commands:
    ```bash
    # Create the issue first
    gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "..."

    # Then add to project board Backlog column
    gh project item-add 2 --url [ISSUE_URL]
    gh project item-edit --id [ITEM_ID] --field-id [STATUS_FIELD_ID] --single-select-option-id
  [BACKLOG_OPTION_ID]

  Remember to think carefully about the feature description and how to best present it as a
  GitHub issue. Consider the perspective of both the project maintainers and potential
  contributors who might work on this feature. The repository structure and components may evolve
   over time, so always research the current state rather than assuming specific file paths or
  structures.

  Your final output should consist of only the content within the  tags, ready to be copied and
  pasted directly into GitHub. Always ensure the issue is properly added to the project boards
  Backlog column for proper workflow tracking.
